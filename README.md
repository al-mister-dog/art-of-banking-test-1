# The Art of Banking. Domain Driven Design. Typescript/Redux-Toolkit
The Art of Banking is a lecture series that utilises a rich interactive interface
created using the principles of Domain Driven Design. Domain Driven Design utilises
design patterns that reflect conceptual structures of a given domain, for example 
the domain of finance or the domain of the health service etc. Such design patterns
can be enlightening for the software programmer because it aids them in structuring
their program in new ways, drawing on useful models that can be adapted to solve particular problems.


## The Banking Domain
Conceptual models may differ for any given domain. In the world of money and economics
there is a huge variety of schools of thought. This program uses a conceptual model
called the Money View, a synthesis of ideas dating back from Walter Bagehot, central 
bankers, to academics such as Jack Treynor, Charles Kindleberger, Marcia Stigum and Perry Mehrling.

The Money View offers an integrated approach for conceptualizing money, finance and (shadow) banking, which it sees as the fundamental infrastructure of capitalism. Notably for the 
programmer it treats every institution (from the Central Bank to the retail customer) as a
class of bank, each striving to maintain liquidity. The glue that holds this web of banks
together is the Dealer and the Market-Maker. This idea has similar counterparts in Object 
Oriented Programming, such as Polymporphism and Inheritance. Below is a more detailed account
of the Money View.
