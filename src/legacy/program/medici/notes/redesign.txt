interface StatusType {
  [key: string]: boolean
}

const bank {
  assets: {},
  liabilities: {},
  balances: {},
  status: StatusType {
    inOverdraft: inOverdraft()
  }
}

function inOverdraft() {}

this.transactionrecord {
  1: {
    time: date(),
    action: withdrawal,
    balance: 100,
    type: 
  }
}

after netting dues it turns out you OWE clearinghouse
how to record this transaction??
transactionRecord: {
  type (liabilities.dueTo);
  id (clearinghouse);
  time: date();
  amount;
}

WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO ADD A RECORD??
maybe map balance??
