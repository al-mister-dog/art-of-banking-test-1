  title: `The Systematic Enrichment of Exchange Bankers`,
  paragraphs: [
    `This module explains how the exchange bankers of the 16th century 
    were able to make profits from bills of exchange. A bill of exchange 
    is a written order used primarily in international trade that binds 
    one party to pay a fixed sum of money to another party on demand or at 
    a predetermined date, similar to a cheque. Merchant traders importing 
    and exporting goods abroad would use bills of exchange as a safe alternative 
    to shipping payment in specie (coins or precious metal). They could simply 
    hand over the bill of exchange to their local exchange banker and receive 
    payment in return. The exchange banker would then draw the bill onto the 
    party that owes the money, and the transaction is completed.`,
    `Given the fact that bills of exchange appear to be simply cheques, as well
    as the fact that in Catholic Europe a banker was not allowed to make a profit 
    from the changing of money, what was the incentive for these exchange bankers 
    to deal in bills of exchange? The truth is that the exchange bankers could indeed
    profit from bills of exchange, but through a complex series of transactions, involving
    associate bankers, other traders and a hierarchical system of exchange rates. 
    The 16th century Italian economist Bernardo Davanziti details one such account in his book 
    Notizia de Cambi, involving bankers and traders from Florence and Lyons.`,
    `Lets go through step by step this series of transactions and learn how we could also 
    side step usury laws and make a neat profit from the art of exchange banking...`,

  paragraphs: [
    `If a merchant ships goods abroad and wants a swift payment then a problem emerges. 
    If they were to receive direct payment from the importer they would have to wait a 
    long time to receive their payment, or even worse the payment could get lost in 
    transport. Bills of exchange were a helpful tool for merchants in this case. The 
    merchant could simply write a bill with amount owed and who owes the amount, and then 
    go to the exchange bank and redeem the bill with amount owed for a local or preferred 
    currency. However the amount specified on the bill was not local currency but a special 
    unit of account.`,
    `In Western Europe during the 16th century the unit of account in
    exchange banking was called the ecu de marc (gold marc). This unit
    would be used for all bills of exchange regardless of country, and was
    then redeemed in local or preferred currencies. The exchange rate of
    the marc would depend on what was announced at the international
    exchange fairs. The fair would take place in the dominant financial
    center of the time. At the time of this exchange, the financial center
    was Lyons (France). Lyons could dicate the price of the marc in any
    currency being used in the network which covered much of Western
    Europe. At the time of this exchange, one marc was worth 64 ecus,
    another coin which would have been an ideal choice for a merchant in
    Florence.`,
    `Here we have three people; Me, a merchant from Florence, You, an
    exchange banker in Florence, and Salviati, a merchant from Lyons. In
    Davanzati's example I (me) ship 1 Marcs worth of goods to Salviati and
    and then sell my Bill to You for 64 ecus.`,

  title: `Remitting Bills`,
  paragraphs: [
    `I (me) have now been paid after presenting the bill to the exchange banker 
    (you) and receiving 64 ecus in return. However, this 64 ecus came out of 
    the exchange banker's equity (from their own funds) which is not very good 
    business. The exchange banker will need to make back these funds and preferably 
    return a profit. To make back these funds the exchange banker needs to send the 
    bill to Salviati using a process called remittance.`,
    `The exchange banker in Florence (you) has an associate exchange banker in Lyons
    (Tomasso), where Salviati lives. The bill will be sent (remitted) to Tomasso who 
    can present the bill to Tomasso and receive the payment required, completing 
    this particular transaction. How a profit is made will be explained in the next 
    module.`,
    `There are now four players on the board; 'Me' and 'You' in Florence, and Tomasso 
    (exchange banker) and Salviati (importer) in Lyons. In Davanzati's example 
    Tomasso receives from 'You' the bill due from Salviati and then presents it to Salviati,
    receiving 1 gold marc (or its Lyonaise equivelant) in return`,

    `Now that the bill of exchange has finally been redeemed where do we stand? As far 
    as 'Me' and Salviati are concerned the transaction is over. 'Me' has received payment 
    for goods shipped and Salviati has paid for goods received. But 'You' have negative 
    equity and Tomasso has 1 gold marc that isn't really his. The gold marc that Tomasso has 
    really belongs to 'You' and will have to pay it back somehow. So what is next for the 
    exchange bankers? Some extra background will help to understand what is next.`,
    `At the central fairs already discussed, exchange rates have been decided and published 
    in what is called the 'conto'. The conto announces what 1 gold marc (the bankers unit of 
    exchange) is worth in different currencies. In Florence, a bill for 1 gold marc drawn 
    in Lyons is worth 64 ecus. This amount is known because it is Lyons who announces how much 
    the gold marc is worth in ecus. This is known as 'quoting certain.`,
    `However, the price of ecus in gold marcs is not known and depends on the state of the market. 
    Other bankers in Lyons can bid for bills in ecus and pay the bearer in marcs. This is known as 
    'quoting moveable'. The city that quotes moveable is lower in the hierarchy than the city that 
    quotes certain. This means that 1 gold marc drawn on Lyons could be 64 ecus but the other way 
    round it could be more, say 65.5 ecus. A banker in Lyons then may buy a bill for 65.5 ecus for 
    1 gold marc. In our example, this price has already been decided. There will be a more complex 
    board where multiple exchange bankers can quote different prices.`,
    `There are two new players on the board; a new importer from Florence, Federigo and a new 
    exporter in Lyons, Piero. In this sense they are the mirror image of 'Me' and Salviati. They 
    will make a transaction that amounts to 65.5 ecus/ 1 gold marc. In Davanzati's example Piero 
    exports goods worth 65.5 ecus to Federigo and presents his bill to Tomasso receiving 1 gold 
    marc in return. Quotes and exchange rates have been added for reference.

    `Tomasso now has a bill for 65.5 ecus in return for his gold marc. This is the first step of

   who will draw the bill on Federigo for 65.5 ecus. The result of this is that 'You' will have
   made back the 64 ecus from the bill bought from 'Me' as well as having made 1.5 ecus profit.`,
    `In Catholic Europe, Usury laws prohibited making interest from loans. This also included 
   selling money for more than its stated price. This transaction circumvates usury laws because 
   in Lyons, the ecus were bought for the price stated in the conto. It just so happens that a 
   gold marc in Lyons will fetch more ecus than a gold marc in Florence. The exchange bankers often
   used this to their advantage using such transaction networks.`,
