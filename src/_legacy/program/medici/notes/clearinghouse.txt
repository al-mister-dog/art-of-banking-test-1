is a clearinghouse just a bank?

clearinghouse = new Bank()
b1 = new Bank()
b2 = new Bank()
b3 = new Bank()
c1 = new Customer()
c2 = new Customer()
c3 = new Customer()

Bank.createCorrespondingAccounts(b1, b2)
Bank.createCorrespondingAccounts(b1, b3)
Bank.createCorrespondingAccounts(b2, b1)
Bank.createCorrespondingAccounts(b2, b3)
Bank.createCorrespondingAccounts(b3, b1)
Bank.createCorrespondingAccounts(b3, b2)

function createClearingHouse(banks, clearingHouse) {
  this.clearingHouse = clearingHouse
  for (const bank in banks) {
    Bank.createCorrespondingAccounts(bank, clearingHouse, 10000)
  }
}

Customer.createSubordinateAccount(c1, b1)
Customer.createSubordinateAccount(c2, b2)
Customer.createSubordinateAccount(c3, b3)

totalAccounts()
return total and make out to designated clearingHouse
ClearingHouse.clearingHouse

clearinghouse certificates are exactly the same as bank deposits. they are a claim on money
to be paid on demand


example
santander owes clearinghouse 40
both banks have totalAccounts

result
before settlement
clearingHouse has asset dues and liability dues
the clearinghouse only has liability chCertificates
santander gives clearinhouse its assets of 40
santander.assets.chCertificates 9960
clearinghouse.assets.chCertificatess = 1040

//NOTES
Each use of the loan certificate required another member bank to refrain from collecting a 
payment of reserves. This individual bank that does not collect reserves essentially makes 
a temporary interbank loan.

Further, the central clearinghouse did not retain the interest paid by banks that borrowed 
loan certificates, so the central clearinghouse was not a lender. The interest on the loan 
certificate accrued to the individual lending bank.

healthy and conservative banks might prefer to cooperate less under a loan certificate 
system if riskier banks regularly required larger borrowings of loan certificates.

step 2: net clearing
net clearing: we gather all of the payments from the day and net them (exchange) so as to 
transfer a smaller quantity of physical money (settlement). 


The settlement process was expedited by allowing banks to store currency at the clearinghouse. 
The clearinghouse created special certificates called clearinghouse certificates that represented 
a claim on actual money stored in a vault and could be used in the settlement.


//FAILURES
After the exchanges but before the settlement, a debtor bank could fail, causing a loss to a 
creditor bank that never accepted a check from the debtor bank.

Therefore, member banks would want assurances that all other members were financially sound.
Gorton and Mullineaux emphasize tactics such as bank examinations and monitoring of bank 
statements that bank clearinghouses employed to ensure the solvency of its members.

if a member bank is a net debtor at the end of the day it has to choose from:
pay in clearinghouse certificates
borrow from another member
default

Once banks suspended payments during panics, clearinghouses could increase the 
expansion of loans. 
Suppose that a bank clearinghouse has two members, Bank A and Bank B.

As a result of the crisis, imagine that both banks declare that they suspend payments, 
and usually this announcement would be made cooperatively at the clearinghouse. 
suspendPayments(bankA, bankB)

Now imagine that the banks want to make loans to their customers who desperately need credit. 
Often times, banks would lend to brokers or stock market operators who required credit 
to facilitate securities transactions. 

Suppose both Bank A and Bank B increase loans by $100. 
Bank A lends $100 to Borrower 1, and Bank B lends $100 to Borrower 2. 
Remember that under suspension, the borrowers cannot withdraw the money in cash, ...
CustomerService.borrow(borrower1, BankA) if (bankA.paymentsSuspended()) {cant withdraw}
CustomerService.borrow(borrower2, BankB) if (bankB.paymentsSuspended()) {cant withdraw}
...so the best they can do is write checks. 
Borrower 1 could write a check to Depositor 1B for $100, and Borrower 2 could write a 
check to Depositor 2A for $100. 
CustomerService.transferByCheck(borrower1, depositor1, BankA, BankB, 100)
CustomerService.transferByCheck(borrower2, depositor2, BankA, BankB, 100)

Now Depositor 1B banks at Bank B and deposits the check for $100 in Bank B, 
and Depositor 2A banks at Bank A and deposits the check for $100 in Bank A. 
CustomerService.depositByCheck(borrower1, BankA, 100)
CustomerService.depositByCheck(borrower2, BankB, 100)
In the clearings, Bank A will owe Bank B $100, and Bank B will owe Bank A $100, 
and thus the two payments will cancel out and settlement requires no payment. 
In this way, 
*the banks can increase their loans without a change in their reserve position.* 
The leadership of the New York Clearing House developed this strategy during the panic 
of 1857, shortly after its founding in 1853 (Myers Reference Myers1931).


But if the check payments are distributed asymmetrically across the banks, 
some banks obtain debtor positions in the clearings.
Now imagine that instead Borrower 1 wrote a $100 check to Depositor 1A who banks at Bank A.
CustomerService.transfer(borrower1, depositor1, )
Bank A can just increase Depositor 1A's account by $100 and decrease Borrower 1's account 
by $100 without any other changes. (already covered)

Thus, at the clearing, there is only one check, written by Borrower 2 which is deposited 
by Depositor 2A at bank A. Therefore, Bank B owes Bank A $100 in the clearings and will 
suffer a reserve outflow at settlement. In general, if spending of the borrowed funds is 
distributed asymmetrically at certain institutions, these institutions would obtain a 
creditor position in the clearings, so other institutions must have a debtor position and 
will suffer reserve outflows. If banks anticipated suffering reserve losses in the event 
that spending was concentrated at other banks, a bank might not want to expand loans, 
thus limiting credit during panic periods when it was needed most by the business and 
financial community.

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
If bankA finds itself in a constant debtor position it will be hesitant to give loans.

if (status.continuousDebtor()) {stopMakingLoans}
if (stopMakingLoans) {businessFail!!!}
