the banking system appears to work well when survival constraint is not taken into 
account. balance sheets merely expand and contract. When survival constraint is 
taken into account then complications arise. 

CLEARING HOUSE SYSTEMS
A clearing house reserves is made up through the subscription of its members.
b1 subscription = 10000
b2 subscription = 10000
b3 subscription = 10000
therefore clearinghouse reserves = 30000

in exchange member banks are given the equivelant of their subscription in clearinghouse
certificates.
b1 chCertificates = 10000
b2 chCertificates = 10000
b3 chCertificates = 10000
certificates act as a claim on the clearinghouse's reserves...
eg "here is a clearinghouse certificate for $1000"


customer A receives x via transfer from customer B (bankB)

        bankA                                   customerA
assets      liabilities              assets                liabilities
reserves x
            deposits(customerA)+     deposits(bankA)+
---
sides of balance sheet not equal


bankB owes bankA
        bankA                                    BankB
assets      liabilities              assets                liabilities
reserves x                           reserves x
            deposits(customerA)+                           deposits(customerA)-
dueFromB+                                                  dueFromA+
---
sides of balance sheet equal but needs to chase various banks


instead of moving reserves bankA receives ch from the clearinghouse
bankB gives ch to the clearingHouse
        bankA                                    BankB
assets      liabilities              assets                liabilities
reserves x                           reserves x
            deposits(customerA)+                         deposits(customerA)- 
cHouse+                                                  cHouse+
sides of balance sheet equal. no need to chase


is the system fool proof?
the banks are safe so long as its customers do not all demand payment in specie/cash
if this happens, the banks will run out of reserves (final source of payment)

one failing bank could demand payment in specie/cash from the clearing house, but if it
is more than their subscription then the clearinghouse system will fail. other banks 
will no longer be able to redeem clearingHouse certificates for specie/cash


IN THE PROGRAM
create banks
each bank has x amount of reserves
it can use some of this reserve to join a clearinghouse
clearinghouse reserves +
bank reserves -

amount of reserves is equal to amount of clearinghouse certificates in the system
